# Landbot frontend challenge
## Description
Implementing a conversational experience can be tricky. With our last release of `@landbot/core`, it's easier to create a conversational experience or another sequential messaging use case. 

At the landbot development team, we're trying to offer an extremely powerful API/SDK tool called `@landbot/core` to let developers create their own custom experience. Frontend developers should be using this tool to create a custom chat GUI or a small website plugin with onboarding capabilities.

The purpose of this challenge is being creative and start a project from scratch, using `@landbot/core` as the basis of a new end use case for landbot. A valid example could be a simple new chat interface, but we encourage to think about another use cases.

## Details
The only requirement is using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the implementation.

Read carefully the documentation from the [docs](./index.md) and take your time before starting the project to think about the design/development possibilities. A simple chat GUI example developed with `VueJS` is available in the examples directory.

## Documentation
> Document your code assuming that the next engineer looking at your code is a serial killer who knows where you live.

Use JSDoc 3 docummentation style. http://usejsdoc.org/

## Coding style
Please, try to follow a coding style guide to keep the code readable and easily debuggable. We recommend using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
