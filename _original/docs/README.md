# Landbot frontend challenge

## Description

Implementing a conversational experience can be tricky. With our last release of `@landbot/core`, it's easier to create a conversational experience or another sequential messaging use case.

At the landbot development team, we're trying to offer a tool called `@landbot/core` to let developers create their own custom experience. Developers can use this tool to create a custom chat UI or maybe a small website widget with onboarding capabilities.

The purpose of this challenge is **being creative and start a project from scratch**, using `@landbot/core` as the basis of a new use case for landbot. A valid example could be a simple new chat interface, but there are lots of possibilities.

## Details

The only requirement is using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the implementation.

Read carefully the documentation from the [docs](./index.md) and take your time before starting the project to think about the design/development. A basic chat UI example is available in the examples directory.
